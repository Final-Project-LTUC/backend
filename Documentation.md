# Socket.io Feature Documentation

## Introduction

The Socket.io feature in this application enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients (users) and handymen. It utilizes the Socket.io library to establish a communication channel over WebSocket connections, allowing instant updates and interactions between different users of the platform.

## Key Components

1. **Socket.io Server Initialization:** The server-side module initializes the Socket.io server, handling user connections and events.

2. **Client Socket Initialization:** The client-side module establishes a Socket.io connection for clients (users), enabling them to interact with the server.

3. **Handyman Socket Initialization:** Similar to clients, the handyman-side module initializes a Socket.io connection for handymen to interact with the server.

4. **Event Handling Functions:** These functions handle various communication events, ensuring seamless interactions and real-time updates.

## Features

### Real-time Task Allocation

- The server receives task requests from clients and sends them to available handymen.
- Handymen receive notifications when new tasks are available.
- Clients receive notifications if their selected handyman is busy.

### Task Status Updates

- The server notifies clients and handymen about task status changes (e.g., task accepted, arrived at the location).
- Handymen can indicate their arrival at the client's location, and clients are informed about this.

### Payment and Scheduling

- Clients make payments for services.
- Handymen confirm payments and schedule task execution.
- Payment and scheduling updates are communicated to both clients and handymen.

### Task Details and Cost

- Handymen provide clients with estimated costs for services.
- Clients receive details about the task's estimated cost.
- Clients can choose to accept or reject the service based on the provided cost.

### Late Arrival Handling

- If a handyman arrives late, the client is informed and given the choice to continue or reject the service.
- Handymen receive updates about the client's choice and subsequent actions.

### Service Completion

- Handymen indicate the start of work after receiving payment.
- Payment and completion updates are shared between clients and handymen.
- Clients can review handymen's performance after task completion.

## Usage

1. **Socket.io Server Initialization:** This module initializes the Socket.io server, managing user connections and event handling.

2. **Client Socket Initialization:** The client-side module establishes a Socket.io connection for clients, allowing them to interact with the server and receive real-time updates.

3. **Handyman Socket Initialization:** Similar to clients, the handyman-side module initializes a Socket.io connection for handymen to interact with the server.

4. **Event Handling Functions:** These functions handle various events such as task allocation, payment confirmation, task status updates, and more.

## Benefits

- Seamless real-time communication between clients and handymen.
- Instant updates on task status, payment, and scheduling.
- Improved user experience with dynamic and interactive interactions.
- Efficient task allocation and tracking for both clients and handymen.

## Conclusion

The Socket.io feature provides a robust foundation for real-time communication between clients and handymen, enhancing the overall user experience and streamlining task management. By leveraging Socket.io, the application ensures prompt updates, interactive interactions, and effective task coordination.

# Unit Testing Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Unit Testing feature is an integral part of our application development process that ensures the reliability, functionality, and quality of our codebase. It involves automating the testing process to validate individual units of code, such as functions, methods, and modules, to ensure they produce the expected results.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Unit Testing feature is to identify and prevent defects early in the development lifecycle, thereby enhancing code stability and reducing the risk of regressions. By isolating and testing code units in isolation, we can catch bugs and issues before they impact other parts of the application.

## Key Benefits

- **Early Bug Detection:** Unit tests help catch bugs and issues during the development phase, reducing the cost and effort of fixing them later.
- **Code Confidence:** A comprehensive suite of unit tests provides confidence that code changes won't inadvertently break existing functionality.
- **Documentation:** Test cases serve as living documentation that illustrates how different parts of the code should behave.
- **Refactoring Safety:** Unit tests make it safer to refactor code, knowing that if tests pass, the expected behavior is maintained.

## Testing Framework

Our Unit Testing feature is supported by a testing framework that provides tools and utilities for creating, organizing, and running tests. We have chosen [Testing Framework Name] for this purpose.

## Test Suite Structure

Test suites are organized collections of test cases. Our test suite structure includes:

- **[Test Suite Name]:** Description of the tested functionality or module.
  - **Test Case 1:** Description of the specific behavior being tested.
  - **Test Case 2:** Description of another behavior being tested.
  - ...

## Writing Test Cases

Test cases are written to cover various scenarios and behaviors. A typical test case includes:

- **Description:** A clear and concise description of what behavior the test case is targeting.
- **Setup:** Any necessary setup or data preparation for the test.
- **Execution:** Executing the code unit being tested.
- **Assertion:** Checking the actual output against the expected output.
## Conclusion

The Unit Testing feature plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality, reliability, and functionality of our application's codebase. By identifying issues early and providing a safety net for code changes, we ensure a smooth development process and a high-quality end product.
